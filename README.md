# Barberia
## A group React project for Founders and Coders Nazareth
Appointment booking system for a small barbershop 

Our project is hosted [Here](https://barberiact.herokuapp.com/)

### `how to install`

You can clone the repo by typing the command

```console
> git clone https://github.com/FACN7/Barberia.git
> cd Barberia
> npm i
> npm start
```

## The project is done in three stages:

### Planning week

* Understanding the problem, the target audience and the environment
* Building a prototype in Figma
* Testing the prototype by interviewing the target group
* Updating the prototype according to the results

### Sprint 1

* Getting familiar with Agile and Scrum
* Building a simpler yet functioning version of the application, suitable for a freelancing barber
 * From the client side - to be able to book an appointment at the barbershop (without seeing which time is already booked for now) 
 * From the barber side - to be able to see all the bookings in one big list
